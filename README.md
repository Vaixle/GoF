Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

## Creational Design Patterns

| **Pattern** | **Example** | **Description** |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| **Abstract Factory**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/creational/abstractFactory)|The abstract factory provides an interface to create a family of dependent or related objects, without specifying any particular class|
| **Factory Method**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/creational/factoryMethod)|The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created|
| **Builder**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/creational/builder)|Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code|
| **Singleton**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/creational/singletone)|Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance|
| **Prototype**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/creational/prototype)|Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes|


## Structural Design Patterns

| **Pattern** | **Example** | **Description** |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| **Adapter**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/adapter)|Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate|
| **Bridge**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/bridge)|Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other|
| **Composite**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/composite)|Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects|
| **Decorator**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/decorator)|Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors|
| **Facade**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/facade)|Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes|
| **Flyweight**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/flyweight)|Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object|
| **Proxy**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/structural/proxy)|Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object|
