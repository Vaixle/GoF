Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

## Creational Design Patterns

| **Pattern** | **Example** | **Description** |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| **Abstract Factory**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/AbstractFactory)|The abstract factory provides an interface to create a family of dependent or related objects, without specifying any particular class|
| **Factory Method**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/factoryMethod)|The Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created|
| **Builder**  |[click](https://github.com/Vaixle/GoF/tree/main/main/builder)|Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code|
